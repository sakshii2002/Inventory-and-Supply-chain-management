This repository contains my personal Power BI project, developed as part of my journey into data analytics. The project demonstrates how raw data can be cleaned, modeled, and transformed into an interactive dashboard that highlights trends, comparisons, and actionable insights.

The focus of this work was to explore Power BIâ€™s capabilities in data modeling, relationships, DAX calculations, and visualization design. I applied different techniques to build a report that not only presents numbers but also tells a story through visuals and key performance indicators.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating meaningful dashboards, applying business intelligence concepts, and strengthening my problem-solving skills with data. This marks an important milestone in my learning path as I continue to explore Power BI, SQL, and advanced analytics for real-world applications.
